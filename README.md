Background Estimation Algorithm with an Automatic Re-initialization Stage and Adaptive Parameters Update.

The Long_BS_Aligned.exe file was created with Matlab2015 R2015a. 

a) Execute the Long_BS_Aligned.exe file.

b) Select the Start button and locate the folder where the video frames are located (in png or jpg format).

The executable will show the input frame, foreground result and the background estimation result.
